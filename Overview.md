**Group 15 – Overview of Progress for Interim Activity Marking**

_This document acts as a reference point for all our activities and documentation so far. Each point will refer to files in our OneDrive document repository (or the mirrored files on GitHub)._

1. **Team Organisation & Meetings**
 - During our initial meetings, we decided on a method to keep track of the 2-3 topics that we want to cover in each meeting, what we need to have prepared for the next meeting and what we should cover in the next meeting. We've formatted this list as 3-column tables (Today/By Next Meeting/During next Meeting). We also decided on having meetings on Mondays 11am and Fridays 10am.
    - **/Meetings/Team Meetings.doc**

  - We had our first Skype Session with Mr. McNamara on Thursday 06/12/2018, where we covered all our desired talking points and assigned a concrete time for our fortnightly Skype sessions.
    - **/Meetings/Skype/Skype01 - Talking Points**
    - **/Meetings/Skype/Skype01 - Minutes**
  - We defined &quot;vague roles&quot; for each team member – meaning that when one role isn't terribly busy they'd pop in and help with the busier ones – so that everyone can experience every aspect of the project.
    - **/Meetings/Team Meetings.doc – Table:: MEET01 – MON 29/10/2018**

2. **Game Concept Decisions**

 - At first, with John's permission, we started to deviate from the original description of the game's concept (ie Arena spaceship game). We first pitched to him the idea of going towards a general RPG direction with Watson PI characteristics integration, and he agreed.
    - **/Game Concept/Initial RPG Idea.doc**
  - We then specified our concept further, by coming up with our final game concept and pitching it to John during our first Skype session. This concept involves Characteristics-Based Teams, Planets, 1-on-1 asynchronous combat and a Ranked system. More details on the project description document:
    - **/Game Concept/Final Game Concept.doc**

3. **Low-Level Prototyping**

  - We've made conceptual prototypes of our game's (Android App) menus and login/signup screens, to see how we'd bring our characteristics-based concept to life. We designed it to envision how the game would ask for Twitter signup and how a player would define their ideal character's personality.

  - We also have conceptual "**Storyboard" designs for each of our game's screens – ie Over-world, Battle Screen, Player-Matchup screens etc.

4. **Diagrams**
  - After having John's approval for our final game concept, we were able to move on with our final steps before coding – composing basic diagrams of gameplay and structural design:

    - **Class Diagram** containing our most important classes and their interactions
        - **/Game Concept/Diagrams/Class Diagram**

    - **Project Internal Structure** containing all the services and backend we'll need to use for user account data storage, Twitter usage, Watson API characteristics.

5. **Learning**
  - Finally, even though we haven't officially started coding yet, with John's guidance and our own interest, we've all grown accustomed to the services and languages we'll use for our entire project.  Members of our team have practiced on NodeRED, nodeJS and the Watson Personality Insights API. Specifically, Yu has already gotten together a python script to extract Watson PI characteristics from a piece of text.
    - **/Game Concept/IBM Cloud API.doc** _==== this should be on Git too_
  - Other members of our team have started learning C# and Unity to kick off the game coding more easily and also practiced Blender, to be ahead in the creation of models for our game.

6. **Blog**

  - We've also set up a blog which details some of the steps we've taken so far in our project.
